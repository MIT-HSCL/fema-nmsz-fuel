# Fuel Distribution Analysis for New Madrid Seismic Zone Emergency Planning

This repository contains the Python models, data preparation scripts, and simulation outputs developed for the capstone project: *Fuel Distribution System Analysis to Support Emergency Planning for a New Madrid Seismic Zone Event*. The project was completed as part of the MIT Supply Chain Management program in collaboration with the MIT Humanitarian Supply Chain Lab and FEMA.

## Project Overview

The New Madrid Seismic Zone (NMSZ) poses a critical threat to downstream fuel distribution infrastructure in the central United States. This project models how a major earthquake could disrupt regional terminal operations and tanker truck flows, and evaluates interventions to improve fuel availability during emergency response scenarios.

We developed and applied:
- Operational Flow Capacity (OFC) modeling
- Discrete Event Simulation in Python
- Scenario analysis across 7 disruption cases
- Data integration from EIA, OPIS, and ArcGIS
- Lever Guidance by Terminal Type (File: 30 Iterations)
